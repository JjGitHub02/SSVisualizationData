# SSVisualizationData
This repository just try to visualize the semantic segmentation of the UAV aerial photos using U-Net model. Dataset using in this visualization are semantic drone dataset from aerial@icg.tugraz.at. If you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following URL: www.dronedataset.icg.tugraz.at

This repository explain how the semantic segmentation technique using U-Net model are applied on the aerial photos data. U-Net is a specific type of Convolutional Neural Network architecture that was developed for biomedical images at the Computer Science Department and BIOSS Center for Biological Signaling Studies, University of Freiburg, Germany in 2015.
